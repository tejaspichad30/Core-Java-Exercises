Q4. ATM with Multiple Account Types
 	Simulate an ATM that handles different account types (savings, checking).

a. If the account type is "savings" and the balance is less than $100, print "Minimum balance required."
b. If the account type is "checking" and the balance is below $50, print "Low balance warning."
c. If the account type is valid and the balance is sufficient, allow withdrawal and print the new balance.
