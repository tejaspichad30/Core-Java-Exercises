7. Switch Case for Days and Activities
 Create a program that suggests an activity based on the day of the week.
Use a switch statement to suggest:
1: "Go to work"
2: "Attend a meeting"
3: "Work from home"
4: "Go to the gym"
5: "Have a family dinner"
6: "Relax and watch a movie"
7: "Prepare for the upcoming week"
If the number is not between 1 and 7, print "Invalid day."*/
