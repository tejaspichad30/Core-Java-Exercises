// Ans - 
//     Difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding
 
// 		        		Method Overloading                                                               Method Overriding
//  
//       
//  	1)	Method Overloading is a compile time polymorphism.             				1)	Method Overriding is a run time polymorphism.
//
//		2)	It helps to increase the readability of the program.                        2)	It is used to grant the specific implement of method which is already provided by its parent class or superclass.
//         
//		3)	Must have different parameters.                                             3)	Must have the same parameters.
//
//		4)	Can have the same or different return type.                                 4)	Must have the same Return type.
//
//		5)	Not depend on Inheritance.                                                 	5)	Depend on Inheritance.
//
//		6)	Static binding is being used for overloaded methods.                        6)	Dynamic binding is being used for overriding methods.
